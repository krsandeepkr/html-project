            The <em series style="background-color: rgb(29, 126, 150)">series was initially intended as a limited series</em> to be told in two parts. It had its original run of 15 episodes on 
            Spanish network Antena 3 from 2 May 2017 through 23 November 2017. Netflix acquired global streaming rights in late 2017.<br/> 
            It re-cut the series into 22 shorter episodes and released them worldwide, beginning with the first part on 20 December 2017,
            followed by the second part on 6 April 2018. In April 2018, Netflix renewed the series with a significantly increased budget 
            for 16 new episodes total. Part 3, with eight episodes, was released on 19 July 2019. Part 4, also with eight episodes, was 
            released on 3 April 2020.<br/> A documentary involving the producers and the cast premiered on Netflix the same day, titled Money Heist:
            The Phenomenon (Spanish: La casa de papel: El Fenómeno). In July 2020, Netflix renewed the show for a fifth and final part, 
            which was released in two five-episode volumes on 3 September and 3 December 2021, respectively.<br/> Similar to Money Heist: The Phenomenon,
            a two-part documentary involving the producers and cast premiered on Netflix the same day, titled Money Heist: From Tokyo to Berlin.
            The series was filmed in Madrid, Spain. Significant portions were also filmed in Panama, Thailand, Italy (Florence), Denmark and in 
            Portugal (Lisbon). A loose remake/continuation set in the same world, Money Heist: Korea – Joint Economic Area, was released on 
            June 24, 2022, while a direct spin-off, Berlin, with Pedro Alonso reprising his role, is in active development, forming a shared universe.[2]
        </p>

        <p>The series received several awards including the International Emmy Award for Best Drama Series at the 46th International Emmy Awards,
            as well as critical acclaim for its sophisticated plot, interpersonal dramas, direction, and for trying to innovate Spanish television.
            The Italian anti-fascist song "Bella ciao", which plays multiple times throughout the series, became a summer hit across Europe in 2018.
            By 2018, the series was the most-watched non-English-language series and one of the most-watched series overall on Netflix,[3]
            having particular resonance with viewers from Mediterranean Europe and the Latin American regions.</p>
